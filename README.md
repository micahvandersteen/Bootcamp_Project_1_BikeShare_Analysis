# Bootcamp_Project_1_BikeShare_Analysis
This is a repository containing a collaborative project analyzing relationships between bike sharing systems, weather, and census data from Boston, MA, Minneapolis, MN, and Portland, OR.

Due to the size of our data files, we had to include them in the .gitignore, so they do not appear in this repository. Rather, they can be found using this googledoc link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18-uabEQ5PpeLGcMGEfV99TNqDKAOpLp6?usp=sharing
